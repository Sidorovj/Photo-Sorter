# Photo-Sorter
Sort photo and video by creation date including all photo from subdirectories renaming them.
This utility will be helpful, when you have many devices taking photo, for example, iphone, Canon 450d, xiaomi and others.
You have made photos from all the devices and now you want to see them in right time sequence. Utility can help you with this.
For example, you have 3 files and 1 directory with 1 photo: 
IMG_20180621_200938.jpg, 
IMG_6111.CR2 , 
VID_20180621_174400.mp4
Mothers / IMG_33.jpg


Utility will create a new folder AppSorted and put into it all files sorted ascending or descending by creation time:
AppSorted / 1__IMG_33.jpg
AppSorted / 2__IMG_6111.CR2
AppSorted / 3__VID_20180621_174400.mp4
AppSorted / 4__IMG_20180621_200938.jpg

So now you can easily view your files in right order using photo viewers.
